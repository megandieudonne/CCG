<h1>A library and Resource</h1>
<h2>Critical Thinking and Reading Written by Women*, LGBT*, and POC*.</h2>

>"All technology reflects the society that produces it, including its power structures and prejudice. This is true all the way down to the level of the algorithm. The outmoded myth, however, that equates the digital and the radical continues to prove counterfeit." 
<p>Legacy Russell, Glitch Feminism, 2020</p>

>"To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body"
<p>Bell Hooks, FEMINIST THEORY from margin to center, 1984</p>
 
>"Our best machines are made of sunshine." 
<p>Donna Haraway, A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late 20th Century, 1984</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is an effort to (re-)build a practice of 'reflective thinking'; to not dwell on how the story of technology is told to us; by the same figures and systems but through the vital narratives made less visible. This resource is linked to <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i>: an entry point into and part of our* common language currently spoken on and away from our* screens.</p>
 
<p><i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> confronts how the body* is constructed and deconstructed online (MFA Thesis, supervised by Prof. Nora Sternfeld, 2021).</p>

<p>To keep things tidy for your Downloads folder, folders are organised alphabetically by First Name, Last Name. File types are mostly: .pdf, .jpg, .png and are named by Title, (Year).</p>

<p>This repository is always in progress and fully accessible.</p>
