<h1>The New World Disorder: A library and Resource</h1>
<h2>Critical Thinking and Reading Written by Women*, LGBT*, and POC*.</h2>

>"All technology reflects the society that produces it, including its power structures and prejudice. This is true all the way down to the level of the algorithm. The outmoded myth, however, that equates the digital and the radical continues to prove counterfeit." 
<p>Legacy Russell, Glitch Feminism, 2020</p>

>"Our best machines are made of sunshine." 
<p>Donna Haraway, A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late 20th Century, 1984</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is an effort to (re-)build a practice of 'reflective thinking' — To not settle for the current story of technology and how it's told; by the same figures and systems but through the vital narratives that have been made less visible. Partly motivated by the research project <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> — all told together & all part of — the common language spoken on and away from our* screens.</p>

<p><i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> explores how the body is constructed and deconstructed online. (MFA Thesis, supervised by Prof. Nora Sternfeld).</p>

<p>To keep things tidy for your Downloads folder, folders are organised alphabetically by First Name, Last Name. File types are mostly: .pdf, .jpg, .png and are named by Title, Year.</p>

<p>This repository is always in progress, and fully accessible.</p>
