<h2>Critical Thinking of Technology: A Library, Imagelog</h2>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>An effort to build: A continuous practice of 'reflective thinking'; A library of critical thinking and reading about technology written by women*, LGBT*, and POC*.</p>

<p>This library was motivated by the current research project: <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> which currently takes shape as a MA Thesis—all in all—another contribution to our* common language taking place on and away from our* screens.</p>
