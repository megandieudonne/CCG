<h1>The New World Disorder</h1>
<h2>Critical Thinking of Technology: A Library and Resource</h2>

>"All technology reflects the society that produces it, including its power structures and prejudice. This is true all the way down to the level of the algorithm. The outmoded myth, however, that equates the digital and the radical continues to prove counterfeit." 
<p>Legacy Russell, Glitch Feminism, 2020</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is an effort to build: A continuous practice of 'reflective thinking'; A library of critical thinking and reading written by women*, LGBT*, and POC*. Motivated by the current research project: <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> which currently takes shape as a MA thesis—all in all—another contribution to our* common language that's taking place on and away from our* screens.</p>

>"This text is about the body. The body as it sits in front of the screen to when it slips beyond. The body that lurks in the in-betweenness of physical and non-physical space and the tension this brings."

<p>Most folders are organised alphabetically by First Name, Last Name and files are named only by Title. This repository is always in progress, and fully accessible.</p>
