<h2>Critical Thinking of Technology: A Library</h2>
<p>An effort to build: A continuous practice of 'reflective thinking'; A library of critical thinking and reading written by women, LGBT, and POC.</p>

<p>This library was motivated by the current research project: <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> which currently takes shape as a MA Thesis, all in all, contributing to 'our' common langauge</p>
