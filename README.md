<h1>The New World Disorder</h1>
<h2>Critical Thinking of Technology: A Library and Resource</h2>

>"All technology reflects the society that produces it, including its power structures and prejudice. This is true all the way down to the level of the algorithm. The outmoded myth, however, that equates the digital and the radical continues to prove counterfeit." 
<p>Legacy Russell, Glitch Feminism, 2020</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>An effort to build: A continuous practice of 'reflective thinking'; A library of critical thinking and reading about technology written by women*, LGBT*, and POC*.</p>

<p>This is motivated by the current research project: <i>Cyborg Cunt Glitch</i> which currently takes shape as a MA thesis—all in all—another contribution to our* common language that's taking place on and away from our* screens.</p>

<p>Folders are organised alphabetically by Name and files are named only by Title.</p>
