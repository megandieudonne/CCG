<p>This text is about the body. The body as it sits in front of the screen to when it slips beyond. The body that lurks in the in-betweenness of physical and non-physical space and the tension this brings. The body as it pushes against the forces that systematically position and oppress it.</p>

<p>The body, neither here nor there. It's about the "tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true" (Haraway, 1984). It's the in-betweeness, or at the very least, the dim awareness of this.</p>
