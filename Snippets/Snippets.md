>This text is about the body. The body as it sits in front of the screen to when it slips beyond. The body that lurks in the in-betweenness of physical and non-physical space and the tension made. The tension: the body as it pushes against the forces that systematically position and oppress it.

The body, neither here nor there. It's about the "tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true" (Haraway, 1984). It's (imprecisely) here that we find ourselves in the in-betweeness—or at the very least—in the awareness of it. <i>Unlisted</i>

>Each section is titled by what it sets out to describe: a creature of fiction (Cyborg), a virus of the new world disorder (Cunt), a failure to function (Glitch)—a body of sorts, of whole and parts.

The body online is constructed through words and image; textual and graphical; you become a ‘body online’ through a speech act. A signifier for the use of the Manifesto genre <i>Unlisted</i> 

A Speech act is something expressed by an individual that not only presents information but performs an action as well. The "modern manifesto" was used to challenge authority, to establish speaking positions for various minorities seeking to be heard: “questions of gender are woven into the fabric of this genre.”

>"Race, gender. age, sexuality. geographical location and other signifiers of “Otherness” interact with this class-based construction of “whiteness” to produce complex hierarchies and contradictions within the Digital Economy. While we can continue to call this “whiteness" because the status quo is still based upon a cultural hegemony that privileges a “white" race, it might be more appropriate to refer to this upwardly mobile subject as a "privileged hybrid transnational subject”
